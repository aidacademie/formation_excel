## What is Tidy/Long Data?
“Long data” is generally used to create a pivot table. Long data is that the number of column is more than the number of raw. Wide data is sometimes used (depends on the operation).

## Why do we need descriptive statistics? 
It summarizes the data to understand easily. It’s usually used in presenting a quantitative analysis of data.  

For example, if we had the results of 100 pieces of students' coursework, 
we may be interested in the overall performance of those students. 
We would also be interested in the distribution or spread of the marks

## Measures of Central Tendency
Measures of central tendency are the most basic and, often, the most informative description of a population's characteristics. 
They describe the "average" member of the population of interest. 
There are three measures of central tendency:
 * Mean -- the sum of a variable's values divided by the total number of values
 * Median -- the middle value of a variable
 * Mode -- the value that occurs most often
 
Example:The incomes of five randomly selected people in the United States are $10,000, $10,000, $45,000, $60,000, and $1,000,000.
  * Mean Income = (10,000 + 10,000 + 45,000 + 60,000 + 1,000,000) / 5 = $225,000
  * Median Income = $45,000 
  * Mode Income = $10,000
  
The mean is the most commonly used measure of central tendency. 
Medians are generally used when a few values are extremely different from the rest of the values (this is called a skewed distribution).
For example, the median income is often the best measure of the average income because,
while most individuals earn between $0 and $200,000, a handful of individuals earn millions.
