# Why is "chart design" important?
Once you get the result in excel, you may create charts or graphs to visualize the results. The charts and graphs are used to make a powerpoint presentation or report. A good visualisation may convince your boss / clients / business partners.

1. When you use a pie chart, you need to consider if your data is accurately visualized. Pie charts are not the best choice if you want readers to compare the size of shares.The example below shows that the pie charts are not clear enough ! Even though there are less than 5 categories...

2. When there are many categories, you better choose another type of chart

3. When there are some categories represent similar values...

4. If the sum of your categories is as important as the categories itself, consider an area chart instead.
